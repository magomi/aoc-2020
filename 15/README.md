Goal(s) for this day
* be consistent with style recommendations as described here: https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/styleguide/styleguide.md

Notes
* for part 1 implementing a solution that builds up a array with all numbers and calculates the distance by searching the whole array
* for part 2 this solution is quite too slow
